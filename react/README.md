# React Text Analyser Coding Challenge

## Introduction
Welcome to the React Text Analyser coding challenge! In this challenge, you'll be working on enhancing a React app that analyses text. The app has a basic structure with a HomePage and a TextAnalyserPage, which is the main focus of this challenge.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `yarn install`.
3. Start the app with `yarn start`.

## Challenge Overview
The goal is to implement various text analysis tasks in the `TextAnalyserPage` component. You will find components like `TextAnalyserCounterItem` and `TextAnalyserTaskItem` that need to be edited to complete the tasks.

**Note:** If you do the challenge as fullstack, please add all the tasks to the backend and call the api.

## Tasks

### Text Analysis Counters
1. Implement the logic for counting words.
2. Calculate the number of unique words in the text.
3. Count the number of sentences in the given text.
4. Determine the number of words in the longest sentence.
5. Count the total number of characters in the text.
6. Calculate the number of lines in the text.
7. Identify and display the number of anagrams in the text.

### Text Analysis Task Items
1. Find the most used character in the text.
2. Determine the most frequent word in the text.
3. Calculate the average reading time for the text (assume an average reading speed).
4. Identify and display the longest anagram in the text.
5. Find the longest palindromic substring in the text.

### Highlight Changes
Highlight all values from Counters and Task Items which were changed when clicking on the "Start analysis" button.

### Tests
Write unit tests to verify the analysis algorithms. 

**Note**: If you do the challenge as fullstack, please add all the unit tests to the backend.

## Components
You will find components like `TextAnalyserCounterItem`, `TextAnalyserTaskItem` in the `src/app/pages/TextAnalyserPage` directory. Edit these components to implement the logic for the tasks.

## Submission
- Fork this repository and create a branch for your changes.
- Implement the necessary changes in the `TextAnalyserPage`.
- Ensure that the app runs successfully using `yarn start`.
- Commit your changes and push them to your fork.
- Submit a pull request with your completed solution.

## Additional Notes
- Focus on clean and maintainable code.
- Use appropriate state management
- Provide comments to explain complex sections of your code.

Good luck!
