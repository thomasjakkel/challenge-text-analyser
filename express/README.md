# Express Text Coding Challenge

## Introduction
Welcome to the Text Analyser Backend coding challenge! In this challenge you will implement some backend functionality for text analysis. The backend, built with Express, will handle the logic for various text analysis tasks, allowing a frontend to make API calls to retrieve the results.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `yarn install`.
3. Start the backend with `yarn develop`.

## Challenge Overview
Your task is to implement the necessary backend functionality for the text analysis tasks. You can define the structure of your project yourself.

**Note:** If you are doing the fullstack challenge the text analysis task only need to be implemented in the backend.

## Tasks

### Text Analysis Counters
1. Implement the logic for counting words.
2. Calculate the number of unique words in the text.
3. Count the number of sentences in the given text.
4. Determine the number of words in the longest sentence.
5. Count the total number of characters in the text.
6. Calculate the number of lines in the text.
7. Identify and count the number of anagrams in the text.

### Text Analysis Task Items
1. Find the most used character in the text.
2. Determine the most frequent word in the text.
3. Calculate the average reading time for the text (assume an average reading speed).
4. Identify and count the longest anagram in the text.
5. Find the longest palindromic substring in the text.

### API Endpoints
- Implement RESTful API endpoints for each text analysis task.
- Create appropriate routes to handle the different tasks.

### API Key
- Implement API key authentication to secure the text analysis endpoints.

### Tests
- Write unit tests to verify the correctness of the text analysis algorithms.

**Note**: If you are doing the fullstack unit test only need to implemented in the backend part.

## Submission
- Fork this repository and create a branch for your changes.
- Implement the necessary changes in the Express backend.
- Ensure that the backend runs successfully using `yarn develop`.
- Commit your changes and push them to your fork.
- Submit a pull request with your completed solution.

## Additional Notes
- Focus on clean and maintainable code.
- Use appropriate error handling in your API.
- Provide comments to explain complex sections of your code.

Good luck!
